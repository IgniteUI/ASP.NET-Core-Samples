### Ignite UI for jQuery Data Grid Remote Ðžperatations

The `DataGrid-Core-RemoteFeatures` is a sample built with the [Infragistics.Web.AspNetCore NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Infragistics.Web.AspNetCore/). It consists of igGrid control with remote editing, filtering, and sorting features. The igGrid's editing utilizes cascading combos, which dynamically load their data remotely and cache it in memory. Additionally, the sample demonstrates how to retrieve the primary key of a newly added row, which is generated from the database. The data layer is extracted to class libraries under the [Persistence](https://github.com/IgniteUI/ASP.NET-Core-Samples/tree/master/Persistence) folder.
